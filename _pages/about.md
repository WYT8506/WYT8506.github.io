I am currently a second-year PhD student at Pennsylvania State University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr.Jinyuan Jia](https://jinyuan-jia.github.io/). My research focuses on AI Security, with a recent focus on LLM explanation. I earned dual bachelor’s degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science from RPI, followed by a master’s in Computer Science from Duke University.


## Current research focuses

* Explaining LLM behavior for security applications
* Certifiable robustness in machine learning models
